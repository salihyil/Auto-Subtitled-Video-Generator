# Session Update: 2023-04-15

## Development Steps

1. `/mlx_whisper_transcribe.py`: Implemented major improvements to transcription and subtitle generation
   - Added word-level timestamp support using `word_timestamps=True` in mlx_whisper.transcribe()
   - Improved subtitle generation with a maximum of 2 lines per subtitle
   - Implemented data loss detection and logging
   - Updated the `write_subtitles` function to handle word-level timestamps and improve subtitle formatting
   - Added option to remove filler words like "um" and "uh"

2. `.ai/codex/codex.md`: Updated learning entry L009 with successful implementation details

## Key Decisions

- Chose to use word-level timestamps for more accurate subtitle synchronization
- Implemented a 2-line maximum for subtitles to improve readability
- Added data loss detection to ensure transcription integrity
- Made filler word removal optional to cater to different use cases

## Next Steps

1. Implement multi-language support for transcription and subtitles
2. Add option for custom subtitle styling (e.g., font, color, position)
3. Optimize performance for longer videos
4. Implement a progress bar or real-time updates during transcription process
5. Add support for batch processing of multiple video files

Progress: Successfully implemented and tested improved transcription and subtitle generation with word-level timestamps. The next session will focus on expanding language support and enhancing user customization options.
